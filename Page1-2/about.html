			<p>CANTON, MI-Upon being informed by the cashier that his assortment of purchases totaled $49.56, local man Josh Molina triumphantly basked Thursday in the glory of using up nearly the exact value of his $50 Target gift card. "Wow, I thought maybe that Twix bar would nudge me over the limit, but it worked out perfectly, just perfectly," said Molina, exulting in victory after spending 20 minutes carefully gathering a group of items that would approach $50 and that would then edge even closer to that amount once tax was factored in. "I figured the coffee machine would use up the bulk of my card, and then when I saw some socks I like on sale for $7.99, I just knew the numbers were going to line up. This is beyond amazing." At press time, Molina had reinserted the now-44-cent gift card into his wallet, where it would remain indefinitely.</p>

			<p>NGARI, TIBET- In the wake of his six-month suspension for false claims of riding in a U.S. military helicopter downed by Iraqi rocket fire, sources confirmed Friday that NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams has ventured to a small hut in the remote Gangdise Mountains in order to quietly meditate on the fickle nature of truth. "Truth itself is in many ways the one universal constant-that which indisputably conforms to reality. But the question remains: Can we as humans understand this concept, or are we forever thwarted by our own individual understanding of the world?", a bearded and unkempt Williams said, gently sipping plum flower tea and staring intently at a creek flowing between two distant snowcapped mountains. "Is truth absolute? Is reality absolute? Or are these concepts majestic castles we construct for ourselves and in which we alone may reside? Perhaps the only truth is that we do not know what is illusion and what is not." At press time, after claiming to have "found [his] own truth in nature," Williams had reportedly decided to remain in the mountains for the rest of his life and promptly submitted his resignation to NBC.</p>
